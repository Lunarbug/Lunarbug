We are in this together.

I am not Kamala, I am a supporter

I know times are hard and this election has us in a dark place, but trust me when I say there is light at the end of this tunnel. Your life is not worth taking over this. To all my Women, Trans kids, LGBTQIA+, and Indigenous people, and POC communities, I see you. You are not alone. I know four years is a lot, but we are all working hard to stay strong and positive. Today, we grieve. Tomorrow, we get to work.

We hope for a better future. Donald Trump is a Racist, a Rapist, a Sexist, a Pedophile, and a Felon. If a felon cannot vote, why should we let one run for president?

I hope you will be with me when I say we want Kamala Harris for 2028! Let's make America blue again. ðŸ’™

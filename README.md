We are in this together.

I am not Kamala, I am a supporter

I know times are hard and this election has us in a dark place, but trust me when I say there is light at the end of this tunnel. Your life is not worth taking over this. To all my Women, Trans kids, LGBTQIA+, Indigenous people, and POC communities, I see you. You are not alone. I know four years is a lot, but we are all working hard to stay strong and positive. Today, we grieve. Tomorrow, we get to work.

As a Bisexual, White/Native American, Woman with Autism, I would like to say to:

Women, I am so sorry that these are the kind of things we have to go through. The price of being alive is being oppressed. The Women's Rights movement has been going on since 1848. To think we came so far and are still fighting proves how strong we are. ‚ô°

LGBTQIA+, you guys have been fighting for over decades. and still to this day, they want to erase us. Gay Rights are something I will not reconsider supporting. üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà

Trans Community, I am so terribly sorry that this is the fate the world has decided for you. You deserve to feel comfortable with your body no matter what. Trans rights till my time ends. üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è

POC communities, I have never been more disgusted with the way America treats you. Your skin color should not be the thing that chooses what kind of person you are. If you have only one white supporter, let it be me. The texts you received the night of November 7th were disgusting and vile, I hope you are all okay.

Indigenous Peoples, I see you. I hear you. Me and you are in the same boat. None of us deserved to go through years of discrimination just for believing in different things and loving our culture. 

Disabled Community (Mental and Physical), I love each and every one of you. we deserve the medical help we are receiving. They want to take that away just because they feel like it. 

SA Survivors, I am so terribly sorry that this is how they are treating you. They want to silence you and your trauma. Don't let them every tell you that you deserved it, no matter what you were wearing.

We hope for a better future. Donald Trump is a Racist, a Rapist, a Sexist, a Pedophile, and a Felon. If a felon cannot vote, why should we let one run for president?

Please Peacfully protest for your rights. I can't imagine losing more of you to sucide and murder. The 4B movement has my full support. I love each and every one of you.

I hope you will be with me when I say we want Kamala Harris for 2028! Let's make America blue again. üíô
